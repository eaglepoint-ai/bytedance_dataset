  "problem_statement": "You are testing a Global Message Sequence (GMS). This system is designed to give every message sent in a distributed chat app a unique, incrementing sequence_id. It uses a Lease system to reduce database hits: it grabs a block of 100 IDs from the DB at once and hands them out from local memory. Generate a pytest test suite to check that the system is implemented correctly to handle a huge amount of load concurrently.",
